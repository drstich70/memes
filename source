<p> I liked this lesson because I learned how to set up a webpage and learneed how to insert a paragraph or text into it, then run it on chrome to see it. I also learned that "HTML" means "hypertext markup language", and "CSS" means "Cascading Style Sheet". </p> <!-- this tag stands for a paragraph> <-->
